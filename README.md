### MA2550: Calculus I - Course Syllabus

**1. Course Information**
*   **Course Title:** Calculus I
*   **Course Code:** MA2550
*   **Credit Hours:** 4
*   **Prerequisites:** Precalculus

**2. Course Description**
MA2550 is an introduction to the fundamental concepts of calculus. This course focuses on limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration of functions of a single variable. We will explore applications of the derivative (including rates of change, optimization, and curve sketching) and applications of the integral (including area, volume, and accumulated change). The course culminates in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which links the two central ideas of the course. Emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding, problem-solving, and the use of calculus in modeling real-world situations.

**3. Learning Outcomes**
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
*   Evaluate limits analytically and graphically, and understand the concept of continuity.
*   Compute derivatives using the definition, rules, and techniques (power, product, quotient, chain).
*   Apply derivatives to solve problems involving rates of change, tangent lines, optimization, and curve sketching.
*   Understand and apply the Mean Value Theorem.
*   Find antiderivatives and evaluate indefinite integrals.
*   Approximate and compute definite integrals using Riemann sums, properties of integrals, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
*   Apply integration to compute areas and volumes.
*   Use appropriate mathematical language and notation to communicate solutions clearly.

**4. Required Textbook**
*   *Calculus: Early Transcendentals*, 9th Edition by James Stewart, or equivalent single-variable calculus text. Earlier editions are acceptable.

**5. Course Requirements & Grading**
*   **Homework (15%):** Weekly problem sets. Collaboration is encouraged for learning, but submitted work must be your own.
*   **Quizzes (15%):** Six (6) in-class quizzes (see schedule). Lowest quiz grade dropped.
*   **Midterm Exams (40% total):** Two in-class exams, each worth 20%.
*   **Final Exam (30%):** Comprehensive, with emphasis on material after Midterm 2.
*   **Grading Scale:** A: 90-100%, B: 80-89%, C: 70-79%, D: 60-69%, F: <60%. (Scale subject to minor adjustment at instructor's discretion).

**6. Policies**
*   **Attendance:** Expected and crucial for success. Not directly graded, but material is cumulative.
*   **Make-up Exams/Quizzes:** Only with **documented** university-approved excuse (illness, emergency). Advance notice required when possible.
*   **Academic Integrity:** All work must be your own. Cheating, plagiarism, or unauthorized collaboration will result in a zero on the assignment and reporting to the appropriate university office. See university academic integrity policy.
*   **Calculators:** A basic scientific calculator is allowed on quizzes/exams. Graphing or symbolic calculators, or phone calculators, are **not** permitted.
*   **Accommodations:** Students with disabilities should contact the university's Disability Services Office to arrange official accommodations. Please present your accommodation letter to me by the end of Week 2.
